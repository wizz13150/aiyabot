# Customized version of the bot. 
Also require to install 3 extensions: ControlNet (Openpose and IPAdapter), Deforum and ADetailer.<br>

May require some manual edit to get it to run, as some values are hardcoded.

# - To generate a prompt from a couple of words, use the /Generate command and include your text as the query.

Command options:

Result:

It's in 'text-completion' mode, not 'chat' mode. This will complete the entered prompt, but will not rephrase.<br>
Then you can select some options, a style, or LoRas (you can click several times on buttons, for several choices).

## Setup requirements

- Set up [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion AI Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).
  - AIYA is currently tested on commit `20ae71faa8ef035c31aa3a410b707d792c8203a3` of the Web UI.
- Run the Web UI as local host with API (`COMMANDLINE_ARGS= --api`).
- Clone this repo.
- Create a file in your cloned repo called ".env", formatted like so:
```dotenv
# .env
TOKEN = put your bot token here
```
- Run AIYA by running launch.bat (or launch.sh for Linux)

## Deploy with Docker

AIYA can be deployed using Docker.

The docker image supports additional configuration by adding environment variables or config file updates detailed in the [wiki](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Configuration).

### Docker run

```bash
docker run --name aiyabot --network=host --restart=always -e TOKEN=your_token_here -e TZ=America/New_York -v ./aiyabot/outputs:/app/outputs -v ./aiyabot/resources:/app/resources -d ghcr.io/kilvoctu/aiyabot:latest
```

Note the following environment variables work with the docker image:

- `TOKEN` - **[Required]** Discord bot token.
- `URL` - URL of the Web UI API. Defaults to `http://localhost:7860`.
- `TZ` - Timezone for the container in the format `America/New_York`. Defaults to `America/New_York`
- `APIUSER` - API username if required for your Web UI instance.
- `APIPASS` - API password if required for your Web UI instance.
- `USER` - Username if required for your Web UI instance.
- `PASS` - Password if required for your Web UI instance.

### Docker compose

- Clone the repo and refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `deploy` directory.
- Rename the `/deploy/.env.example` file to `.env` and update the `TOKEN` variable with your bot token (and any other configuration as desired).
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the bot.

## Notes

- [See wiki for notes on additional configuration.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Configuration)
- [See wiki for notes on swapping models.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Model-swapping)
- [📋 requires a Web UI script. Please see wiki for details.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-and-other-tips-(setup)#the--and-other-png-info-related-commands-are-not-working)
- Ensure AIYA has `bot` and `application.commands` scopes when inviting to your Discord server, and intents are enabled.
- As /settings can be abused, consider reviewing who can access the command. This can be done through Apps -> Integrations in your Server Settings. Read more about /settings [here.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/settings-command)
- AIYA uses Web UI's legacy high-res fix method. To ensure this works correctly, in your Web UI settings, enable this option: `For hires fix, use width/height sliders to set final resolution rather than first pass`


## Credits

#### Foundation
AIYA only exists thanks to these awesome people:
- AUTOMATIC1111, and all the contributors to the Web UI repo.
  - https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
- harubaru, my entryway into Stable Diffusion (with Waifu Diffusion) and foundation for the AIYA Discord bot.
  - https://github.com/harubaru/waifu-diffusion
  - https://github.com/harubaru/discord-stable-diffusion

#### Great Contributors
These people played a large role in AIYA's development in some way:
- solareon, for developing a more sensible way to display and interact with batches of images.
- danstis, for dockerizing AIYA.
- ashen-sensored, for developing a workaround for Discord removing PNG info to image uploads. *edit* Discord is no longer doing this at the moment, but credit is still due.
  - https://github.com/ashen-sensored/sd_webui_stealth_pnginfo 
- gingivere0, for PayloadFormatter class for the original API. Without that, I'd have given up from the start. Also has a great Discord bot as a no-slash-command alternative.
  - https://github.com/gingivere0/dalebot
- You, for using AIYA and contributing with PRs, bug reports, feedback, and more!
